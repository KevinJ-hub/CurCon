# CURRENCY CONVERTER

This is a project made by [Kevin Joshi](https://github.com/KevinJ-hub)  
It is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and uses a currency conversion api by [Currencylayer](https://currencylayer.com/)  

There is an **easter egg** 🥚️ added to this project that will unlock extended functionality.  
**HINT:** You will have to use dev tools to find it out 😉️  

The web app has dark as well as light mode 🌚️>>>🌝️  
The whole website has been made flexible and has been developed for desktop and mobile devices  

> **NOTE:** Since the app is hosted for free on heroku it goes to sleep on 30 mins of inactivity so there might be a possibility that the app takes a few seconds to load INITIALLY so please be patient. Also the api is used with a free subscription which has a limit of 250 requests per month so only 250 request will be served per month. (The count of requests made can be found at the bottom of the app)
